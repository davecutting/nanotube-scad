# nanotube-scad
A python script for generating SCAD models of carbon nanotubes from avogadro coordinate lists.

Please see https://github.com/wose/nanotube-scad for a command line version based on this work

## Instructions
Install the libraries, then run the script. You'll need to specify the file name, which needs to be in the same directory as the script. Don't include the extension - It's assumed to be .txt
